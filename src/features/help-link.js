/**
 * /?help: the planner opens with “How it works” (the Help dialog) on screen.
 * The Contact page's “Help in the planner” leads here.
 *
 * Read once, as the planner loads (app.js, on the frame first-run setup and
 * gift or licence links are handled), then taken out of the address
 * (history.replaceState) so a reload, a bookmark or the installed app's
 * next start opens the planner as usual.
 *
 * - A first run: first-run setup shows, then the planner tour, which ends on
 *   “How it works” itself. Help is not added on top of either: it would only
 *   make a newcomer close one more dialog before the tour.
 * - A gift, purchase or licence link in the same address opens its own
 *   dialog: Help gives way to it.
 * - Otherwise Help opens, on the same frame as those, before the planner's
 *   entrance plays its first frame: the entrance finds a dialog open and
 *   steps aside (src/features/app-entrance.js), the planner simply appears.
